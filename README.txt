Project Description: 
This program is intended to be run from the command line and does all of its activity in the terminal.
It will demonstrate various search algorithms and their relative efficiency.
The algorithms explored will be depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search, and astar search.
The efficiency of the algorithms will be determined by:
    - path found
    - computational time spent searching
    - amount of memory used

TODO:
1. Implement the other search algorithms
    ^ implement priority queue
    ^ brush up on heuristic functions (make it a simple one)
        ^ maybe pass function pointer to priority queue sort ?
2. Build main.c to allow you to try different functions w/ cl arguments.
    ^ maybe have an option where it runs all three on the same board!
3. Show all your friends.

to build: make
