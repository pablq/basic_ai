Project Description: 
This program is intended to be run from the command line and does all of its activity in the terminal.
It demonstrates four different search algorithms and their relative efficiency.
The algorithms explored are Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* search.
The following information is presented for each algorithm:
    - Movement cost of path found.
    - Approximate computational time spent
    - Approximate memory usage.

The goal of this program is to provide the user with a basic introduction to pathfinding considerations.

to build: make
to clean: make clean
to run: ./basic_ai

*All of algorithms make use of a closed set to avoid re-checking gamestates
