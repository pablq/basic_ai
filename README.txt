Project Description: 
This program is intended to be run from the command line and does all of its activity in the terminal.
It will demonstrate various search algorithms and their relative efficiency.
The algorithms explored will be depth first search, breadth first search, uniform cost search, and astar search.
The efficiency of the algorithms will be determined by:
    - path found
    - computational time spent searching
    - amount of memory used

to build: make
to run: ./basic_ai
